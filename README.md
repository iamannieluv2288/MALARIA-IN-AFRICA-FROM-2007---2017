This analysis provides insights into malaria cases across 54 African countries over a ten-year period, focusing on trends, demographic distributions, and healthcare interventions. The findings from this dashboard offer valuable insights for healthcare organizations, policymakers, and international bodies to strategize disease prevention and resource allocation.

METHODS USED:

1.Data Collection and Cleaning:

·         The raw dataset likely included malaria case statistics, population demographics, and healthcare services by country over the specified period.

·         Data cleaning techniques

2.Data Aggregation:

·         Summation and averages were calculated for variables like malaria incidence, reported cases, rural/urban population, and healthcare interventions.

·         Grouping data by year, country, and category (e.g., rural population) helped create detailed trends and comparisons.

3.Visual Design:

·         Key performance indicators (KPIs) were created for high-level summaries (e.g., total countries analyzed, average malaria cases reported).

·         Chart types such as line graphs, bar charts, and donut charts were used to visualize trends, distributions, and proportions effectively.

4.Insights Derivation:

Trends in malaria cases, rural/urban population distributions, and healthcare interventions were analyzed to identify high-risk countries and areas requiring focus.

TOOLS USED:

1.Power BI:

·         Utilized for data visualization and interactive dashboard design.

·         KPIs were leveraged to make the dashboard dynamic and informative.

 

KEY INSIGHTS:

1.Total number of 54 African countries are included in the analysis.

2.This analysis showed that there is an average of 190.09 Incidence of Malaria per country in the African countries considered.

3.This analysis recorded a total Reported Malaria Cases of 1.07 million across all countries.

4. Population Context: Average Rural Population is 56.84% of the population and Average Urban Population is 43.16% as observed from the analysis.

5. Sum of Incidence of Malaria & Sum of malaria reported cases by Year: it was observed that there was a significant increase in the reported malaria cases from 2007 to 2017, peaking at 1.28 million in 2017, and Steady rise in incidence rates between 2008 and 2016, reflecting either increased reporting or worsening conditions.

6. Preventive Treatment of Malaria in Pregnancy by country: The analysis showed that Ghana pays more attention to providing preventive malaria items for pregnant women, leading with 166 cases, followed by Zambia (117), Malawi (115), Sierra Leone (101), and Senegal (91)

7. Children Receiving antimalaria drugs by Malaria Cases: It was observed from the analysis that 76.47% of children with fever receive antimalarial drugs, but there is a notable portion (23.53%) not receiving treatment.

8. Safety Managed Sanitation by Country: This analysis shows that Tunisia has the highest safety sanitation coverage recording a total of 799.09, followed by Egypt (639.42) and Morocco (412.66).

9. Incidence of Malaria & Avg. Rural Population by Country: A correlation exists between rural population percentages and malaria incidence. Countries with higher rural populations tend to have higher malaria cases, likely due to limited access to healthcare and sanitation. As observed from the analysis Burkina Faso recorded the highest population in Rural area totaling 17.98k and this resulted to the increase in incidence of malaria in the country amounting to 5.8k incidence, followed by Congo republic, Mozzambique, Uganda and Burundi.

10.Incidence of Malaria & Avg. Urban Population by Country: Burkina Faso recorded highest population of 5.3k in the urban area and a total of 58 incidence of malaria cases, followed by Sierra Leone, Central African Republic, Benin and Cote d'Ivoire.

11.Malaria cases reported by Country: It was observed from the analysis that Congo recorded the highest Malaria cases of 78M cases, Mozambique (42M), Burkina Faso (41M), and Uganda (40M).

12.Despite Tunisia and Egypt having relatively high sanitation services, they report fewer malaria cases, suggesting improved sanitation and healthcare reduce malaria prevalence.

13.While many countries report high malaria incidences, countries with better sanitation, such as Tunisia and Egypt, show significantly lower numbers, which is an anomaly worth exploring further.

 

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1.Countries with high-incidence like Congo, Mozambique, and Burkina Faso should scale up preventive treatments.

2.Expand access to antimalarial drugs for children, especially in underserved regions like Uganda where treatment rates are low.

3.Promote investments in sanitation services across malaria-prone areas, inspired by Tunisia and Egypt's success in reducing cases through better-managed sanitation.

4.Countries should deploy mobile healthcare units and awareness campaigns in rural areas where malaria incidence correlates with higher population percentages.

5.Encourage data sharing and collaboration among countries to identify best practices in reducing malaria cases, especially for the countries with the lowest incidence.

6.Ensure that all countries have robust systems for reporting malaria cases, as increased surveillance leads to better resource allocation.

7.Direct funding to high-burden countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo and Mozambique.

8.Promote malaria prevention through educational programs targeting high-risk populations, particularly in rural areas.

9.Investigate year-over-year increases in malaria cases and assess the impact of climate factors.
